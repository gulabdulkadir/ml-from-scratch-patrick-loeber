# Machine Learning from Scratch
Implementation of machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python and NumPy. Following Patrick Loeber's series.
This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms built from scratch using Python and NumPy.

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to understand the mathematical foundations and underlying logic of machine learning algorithms by implementing them without using high-level libraries like Scikit-Learn.

Content
The following algorithms have been implemented as part of my machine learning education:

-Linear Regression
-Logistic Regression
-Decision Tree
-Random Forest
-SVM (Support Vector Machines)
-PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
-KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
-AdaBoost
-K-Means
-Naive Bayes
-Perceptron

Acknowledgments:
These implementations were developed following the "Machine Learning from Scratch" series by Patrick Loeber. The logic and structure are based on his educational content to ensure a deep understanding of the algorithmic processes.

Requirements:
-Python 3.x
-NumPy
-Matplotlib (for visualization)
